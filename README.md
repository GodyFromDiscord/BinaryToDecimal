# BinaryToDecimal

---

## **Purpose**
The purpose of this repository is to show a simple Binary to Hexadecimal converter made using Javascript.

The fundamentals of this are to provide the following;
1. The user can enter up to **8** digits into one input
2. The user will be notified if they have entered anything other than a **1** *or* **0**
3. The user can see the results in a single output field which will contain the hexadecimal value (base 10 equivalent) of the binary number that was entered
